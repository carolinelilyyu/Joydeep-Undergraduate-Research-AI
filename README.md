# Joydeep-Undergraduate-Research-AI

Part of my undergraduate research for Joydeep Biswas 2017 (UMass Amherst). This repo handles image detection/machine learning using Pycharm. It also handles the minimax algorithm or AI's turn for Tic Tac Toe. This was written in Python and communicates to C++ or Joydeep-Undergraduate-Research-GUI-Tic-Tac-Toe through ZMQ
